# Global Conflict Economic Impact Analysis: An In-depth Study: Data Analysis Notebook


### Introduction

This research project explores the economic impact of global conflicts, with a focus on comprehensive analysis of financial market data. By recognizing the significant economic changes that conflicts bring about, both regionally and internationally, this study aims to offer valuable insights into how these events influence global economic indicators and market dynamics.

### Project Objectives

The main goal is to conduct a thorough analysis of financial market data during conflict periods in different sectors such as finance, defense, healthcare, construction, and energy. The aim is to understand how these sectors perform and remain resilient amid conflict. Through this study, I hope to provide valuable insights into the economic aspects of global conflicts, thus improving our understanding of their impact on market trends and economic stability.

### Data Analysis Framework

The analysis starts by loading relevant datasets, including the comprehensive data provided by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which covers arms imports and exports from 1950 to 2022. This initial data forms the basis for a more extensive examination of economic trends during periods of conflict, to shed light on the intricate relationship between geopolitical events and economic dynamics.
